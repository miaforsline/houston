# EDS 223 HW Assignment 2: Spatial Analysis 
### Authors: Mia Forsline and Alexandra Yousefivand 
### Due date: 2021-10-24

The PROJECT GOAL is to quantify the severity of **power outages** caused by a Texas storm in February 2021. Night lights image data from **NASA's Worldview** were examined, in conjunction with **Open Street Map** data of roads and buildings, to display a blackout mask of Houston. Brightness was compared before and after the storm to calculate the number of Houston homes that were affected by the power outages.

As this project is intended for **educational purposes**, the student creators practiced loading vector and raster data and executed simple geoprocessing operations, including spatial joins.

FUTURE RESEARCH aims to investigate whether there is a pattern between a particular socioeconomic factor and susceptibility to the power outages caused by the recent storms. Spatial census data layered on the blackout mask may reveal new insights into which populations are more likely affected by future storm outcomes.

The following packages were utilized during this analysis:
- `sf`
- `stringr`
- `stars`
- `rgdal`
- `dplyr`
- `tmap`
- `lintr`
- `rosm`
